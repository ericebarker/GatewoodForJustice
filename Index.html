                <h4>What is Gatewood Running For?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                            <strong>LEADERSHIP FROM THE GROUND UP</strong> Rev. Curtis Gatewood supports the autonomy of local branches and believes that each chapter is best-equipped to understand the issues and challenges facing its constituency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>GRASSROOTS COLLABORATION</strong> Rev. Gatewood is acutely aware that change will not happen if we sit on the sidelines and wait. He is a passionate advocate and facilitator of grassroots collaboration between diverse community partners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>STAND AGAINST HATE</strong> Rev. Gatewood will fight to resist abuses of power that negatively affect people of color and he will take an unequivocal stance against racist, xenophobic, homophobic, anti-Muslim, misogynist and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>INVOLVED LEADERSHIP</strong> Rev. Gatewood knows that true leadership involves more than a photo opportunity. He visits with youth in the public schools, speaks with residents of public housing and listens to the stories of those in the justice system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY</strong> Rev. Gatewood plans to enact timely audits of our financial records, create sound budgeting and increase fundraising efforts for financial independence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>INCREASED MEMBERSHIP AND BRANCH COMPLIANCE</strong> Rev. Gatewood is committed to membership recruitment and retention efforts and determined to assist branches with the tools and resources they need to gain compliance. He views these aspects as a critical benchmark to the health of the NAACP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>RECIPROCAL COMMUNICATION</strong> Rev. Gatewood advocates for greater communication between the state conference and branches, as well as with the support base. Rev. Gatewood understands that communication means more than solicitation for funding, it is a vital exchange of ideas and information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS</strong> Rev. Gatewood believes that we bear a responsibility to hold elected officials accountable to diverse populations and interests. At the same time, we must ensure voting access and promote greater participation in the electoral process as a vehicle of change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            <strong>PROMOTE JUSTICE IN ALL WE DO</strong> At the core of Rev. Curtis Gatewoodâ€™s work is the philosophy that we must consciously and consistently demand justice from every imaginable principality and every person in a place of power. Rev. Gatewood is guided in words and actions by the idea that we must humbly learn to treat each other justly and work together to provide greater love, care and protection of all people.
