                            Curtis E. Gatewood has dedicated his life in serving the NAACP and fighting for justice. A lifetime member of the NAACP, Rev. Gatewood has been active in the organization since the age of 10.

Rev. Curtis Gatewood wants to use his decades of experience of leadership and action to create a united vision for the NC NAACP, one which embodies the ideal of “leadership from the ground up.”
